## Why should I contribute to open-source?

Contributing to open-source describes a lot about you as a community member.

* **You are passionate**  
You are writing thousands of lines of code, drawing diagrams, building assets and running tests because you are
passionate about it and not because you want to get paid for it. You absolutely love what you are doing and in
the long run, your future employer expects the same sort of interest while working with them.

* **You are confident**  
You are confident about your creation and ready to face public criticism about it. With those reviews and
comments taken on a positive note, you are willing to work tirelessly to make all changes to build better stuff. An
average developer breaks a sweat to get an upstream while you know how good you can be.

* **You are comfortable**  
You are not overwhelmed when your project scales up rapidly with multiple dependencies and concurrent
contributors. It clearly tells a lot about how comfortable you are in reading a foreign code and how you can adapt
to the stated requirements. Better yet, you can make people match your requirements too.

* **You are interactive**  
You are aware about how you should interact with the fellow contributors and how you should ask for
assistance. Working as a player in a multi-talented team is important and soon you would find yourself giving
your best to bring together the best works of every teammate into a single magical project.

* **You are informed**  
You are skilled about a stack and have garnered tons of experience with many projects. To move on to newer a
stack would require you to go through documentation – which is cool. But getting to learn new technologies
from your fellow community members while teaching them what you know is definitely cooler.

* **You are helpful**  
You are going to start from where you are. If it is zero that you are starting from, you will most likely get lots of
help for your task. If you have previous experience in your field, you can pretty much help other newbies to start
off. Open-source contributions are done as a hobby and you get also get to manage your time.

* **You are collective**  
You are a part of a collective. Open-source movement is all about helping people through software applications
and services with open codebases. There is a palpable sense of freedom in choosing how you would tackle
problems. You are free to make fork a project and add stuff that you think would make it better.
