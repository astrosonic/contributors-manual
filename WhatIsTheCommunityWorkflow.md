## What is the community workflow?

The community follows two distinct kinds of workflow which makes us different from other open-source communities.

* **Release Workflow**~~~~  
Members participating in this workflow are completely dedicated onto building a single project at any point of
time. They are in complete control of the direction of the project but cannot decide how successful it can be
down the line. This requires a minimum of five effective contributions per week. This workflow is the most
focused and hugely challenging.

* **Rolling Workflow**  
Members participating in this workflow are completely dedicated onto maintaining multiple projects at any point
of time. They do not have a say in the direction of the project but can pretty much decide how successful it can
be down the line. This requires a minimum of three effective contributions per week. The workflow is moderately
focused and greatly challenging.
